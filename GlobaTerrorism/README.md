Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism
Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a terrorism dataset. The goal is to gain insights into the patterns, trends, and characteristics of terrorist activities around the world.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), which is an open-source database that includes information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2019. The dataset can be downloaded from the GTD website.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset
Handle missing values
Clean and transform the data as needed
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Analyze the distribution of various features (e.g., attack types, target types, weapon types)
Investigate the temporal trends of terrorist incidents
Explore the geographical distribution of terrorist attacks
Identify the most active terrorist groups and their characteristics
Analyze the relationship between different attributes of terrorist events
Visualization:

Create informative visualizations to showcase the findings
Use appropriate chart types (e.g., bar plots, line plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, choropleth maps)
Enhance the visualizations with clear labels, titles, and annotations
